This BST will take any sorted vector of integers and place them into a BST.

The program will prompt the user for k and will then find the kth smallest element in the tree.

Any time the numbers are printed, it is the in-order traversal of the tree.
After the kth smallest element is printed, the tree will recursively invert itself and do another in-order traversal.
